WARNING: The maximum number of SNPs has been set to 7000, which is greater
    than the number of bi-allelic SNPs with sufficient information (6656) for SNAPP.

INFO: Retained 6656 bi-allelic sites.

WARNING: As no starting tree has been specified, a random starting tree will be used by
    SNAPP. If the random starting tree is in conflict with specified constraints, SNAPP
    may not be able to find a suitable state to initiate the MCMC chain. This will lead
    to an error message such as 'Could not find a proper state to initialise'. If such
    a problem is encountered, it can be solved by providing a starting tree in which
    the ages of constrained clades agree with the constraints placed on these clades.

Wrote SNAPP input in XML format to file snapp.xml.
